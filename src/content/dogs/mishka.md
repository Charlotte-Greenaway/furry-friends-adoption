Older dogs can make the best companions and our lovely Mishka certainly does just that!
Mishka is a smashing girl who just loves to be in the company of people. It is sad to see old dogs in kennels, and although she took everything in her stride it was obvious that she was missing the comforts of a home.
Sadly some medical issues delayed us being able to make her available as quickly as we would have liked but thankfully Mishka has been lucky enough to be placed in a wonderful foster home where she has settled in quickly and has been a joy to care for.

Mishka mixed well with other dogs during her time here at the Centre and has continued to get on very well with other dogs when out and about with her fosterers.
She is very clean in the house and lets you know if she wants to go into the garden. She travels well in the car and enjoys being out and about.

Mishka walks calmly on the lead but unfortunately is pretty hard of hearing nowadays, so any off lead exercise can only be done in secure locations.

Mishka's ideal home would be a quiet home with someone who just wants a dog for companionship, so if you have a Husky sized hole in your life please get in touch.
