title: "LEO"
description: "Leo is a nervous boy who is looking for patient owners who will allow him time to settle into their home. He can be very affectionate once he knows you and he loves his walks, getting excited every time he sees the carer get his lead. He has lived in a home before so we know that he is already house trained and has been left previously. When settling into the new home Leo will need a safe space, such as a dog crate, he can have access to. Although Leo has lived in a home before, any adopter must be prepared to take the time to help him settle in at his own pace."

Leo is a nervous boy who is looking for patient owners who will allow him time to settle into their home.

When settling into the new home Leo will need a safe space, such as a dog crate, he can have access to. Although Leo has lived in a home before, any adopter must be prepared to take the time to help him settle in at his own pace.
