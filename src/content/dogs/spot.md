Meet our gentle soul Spot, looking for a quiet and understanding home, ideally with experience with the Collie breed. We do not know much about Spots past, but he appears to be under socialised as finds many things quite overwhelming. He is therefore looking for a new home that can provide him a safe haven to slowly build his confidence in time. Spots favourite pass time is playing with his squeaky toys! He will often bring his favourite toy over to you and place it on your lap, followed by a nudge to ask you to throw it! 

Typical to the collie breed, Spot is very intelligent and is a quick learner. Owners who are keen to take on extra fun training activities (e.g. fun agility, flyball) will help Spot thrive in his new home and keep him mentally stimulated.Spot appears to not have much experience with walking on a lead so can be strong at times, especially when he sees wildlife.
