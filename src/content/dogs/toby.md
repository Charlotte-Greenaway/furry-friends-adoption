Meet Toby, a sweet dog in search of his special home!


Toby will make a loving companion to the right person. He enjoys walks and playing with his toys. Although he can be a bit picky at meal times, he loves shredded chicken dog food and the finer things in life like ham.


Toby is quite the ladies' man and feels much more comfortable around women, though he can be a little unsure of men. Initially wary of strangers, he warms up with patience and time. Once settled, Toby likes being stroked around his chest and ears and may even sit on your lap if he feels comfortable and confident.


Toby seeks a patient and understanding adopter who will allow him to settle in at his own pace. Ideally, this person will be home often, providing the time, attention, and love he deserves. Toby has a personalised training program to help him settle in and thrive in his new surroundings. New adopters should be attentive to Toby's body language, allowing him to initiate interactions and recognising when he requires personal space.


With the right care, we know Toby will blossom into a loyal and affectionate companion.
