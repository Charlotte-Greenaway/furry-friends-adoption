title: "NARLA"
description: "Narla is our loveable, food motivated pug. She can be very affectionate when she wants to be, but also enjoys her independent moments so she never becomes too much. Narla loves her walks and always likes to say hello in passing to other dogs. Where she is so food motivated she is a joy to train but consequently isn't too interested in playing with toys. Narla has separation anxiety so she is looking for a home with patient owners who are willing to work over a long period of time to try and help her overcome this."
