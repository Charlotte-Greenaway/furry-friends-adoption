Buddy is a sweet older gentleman with a playful spirit and a heart full of love. This charming Jackaranian is ready to find his forever home where he can enjoy his golden years with a snuggle or two on the sofa.

His favourite pastime is his never-ending selection of toys, enjoying play times with his human friends here and by himself, his playful nature makes him a delightful companion. Whilst Buddy enjoys meeting dogs and saying hello on his walks, he would thrive best as the only dog in the home, though he wouldnâ€™t mind the occasional visit from canine friends.

Buddy still enjoys the great outdoors and walks are a highlight of his day and as such he has potential to live without a garden. Buddy has his anxious moments and is looking for a quiet and patient home to settle, but once you are good friends with Buddy, he would like to accompany you around the home and be a loyal companion. Buddy would need time left alone built up gradually, but we have high hope for his housetraining progress in the home!
