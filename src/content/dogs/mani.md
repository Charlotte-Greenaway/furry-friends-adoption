Meet Mani, a loving young boy looking for an experienced and patient adult only home to thrive in. He is looking for a quieter home without lots of visitors, no visiting children and a structured routine to settle into.
Mani could be a companion dog candidate and will need his own secure garden space to help provide a outlet for his playtime and exercise. One of his favourite past times is having a never-ending supply of toys to play with, so play times will be a great way to get to know and bond with Mani. 

His favourite toy at the moment is a football which provides many hours of fun downtime.Mani does not enjoy sharing space with other dogs and will benefit from walks in quiet areas, he wears a muzzle and wears it well on all walks and will need to be kept on lead and muzzled when out and about.Â  Mani can be overwhelmed around strangers and needs new owners who can appreciate their need for down time and read their body language to know when they are feeling less comfortable.
