Meet our sweet girl Patrica who is on the search for her new forever home. We are unsure of Patricia’s past and if she has ever lived in a home, so she will need to be given time to settle into her new environment slowly. One way to Patrica’s heart is through food! She is very food motivated so will need management around this in the home as well. 

Patrica is looking for patient and understanding owners who are looking for a project dog as she can be very worried by the outside world. With time, patience and training we hope Patrica will flourish in her new home.
