Introducing our cheeky chap, Rodger! Rodgers favourite things in life are his squeaky tennis balls; he will often be seen throwing them around entertaining himself! Once he has had a good play session, he will then join his favourite carers for a cuddle. Rodger will need help settling into a home environment, so is looking for owners who are knowledgeable on positive training techniques to help him learn house manners. 

Being a younger lad, Rodger is keen to greet other dogs and can sometimes be a bit too much, so may need some management when meeting up with doggy friends.Rodger has a high prey drive and can be worried by busy traffic.
