title: "ASTRA"
description: "Astra is a beautiful girl who was removed from a property with a large number of cats. Astra is a timid cat who has not had the socialisation she needed in her earlier life, but is slowly learning to trust again. We have been working closely with her to build her confidence and she is now comfortable taking her favourite treats from our hands and observing us from her favourite cosy spot. With continued time and patience, Astra is showing promise of blossoming into a sweet little character; she just needs someone to give her that opportunity in the comforts of a home environment.Due to Astra's timid nature, she is best suited to an adult-only home as the only pet.If you meet all of the above rehoming criteria, please complete this Online Application Form. It is really useful if you can please include lots of information on the type of home you can offer."
