title: "TIMMY"
description: "Timmy is a very lovely 2 year old who is now ready to find his forever home. He was very worried when he first arrived at the shelter, however once he got to know us all he soon settled and became best friends with everyone. He is very loving and friendly boy who adores lots of fuss off his human friends. He enjoys rolling around in catnip or snoozing in the sunshine. He does not like other cats so will need to be the only one in the home. We would need to get to know him better to see if he could live with a cat friendly dog. He may be able to share his home with secondary school children depending on the meet at the shelter."
