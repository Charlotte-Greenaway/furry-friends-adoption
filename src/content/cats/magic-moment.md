title: "MAGIC MOMENT"
description: "Meet Magic Moment, a stunning and timid cat in search of a quiet and patient home where he can adjust and warm up to his new owners at his own pace.With limited history, we can't fully predict how Magic Moment will behave in a home environment. However, with time and understanding, we believe he will relax and come to enjoy human interaction.Currently, he allows some strokes and shows interest in toys, and we are confident this will progress as he becomes more comfortable. Magic Moment needs to be the only cat in the home and can live with older children.He is seeking a patient and understanding family who will give him the time and space to feel safe and secure. We hope that, over time, Magic Moment will start to learn to trust. If you have room in your heart and home for this beautiful boy, he will surely reward you with his gentle companionship."
