description: "Toast and Marmalade are a stunning pair of kittens aged around 13 weeks old. They are typical kittens in their playfulness and high energy and will need someone to be around for most of the day whilst they're young. Marmalade is the braver of the pair and will investigate you before enjoying a good fuss. Toast can be cautious at times and prefer to observe from a distance, but also enjoys the company of people once he's had the chance to familiarise.Toast and Marmalade would cope with sharing their home with a cat-friendly dog and children of primary school age or above.
