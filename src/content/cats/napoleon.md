title: "NAPOLEON"
description: "Napoleon is a gorgeous 5 year old boy looking for his forever home. He is a confident lovely boy who enjoys a gentle fuss and attention off his human friends. He can be quiet vocal at times in new surroundings. He is a very playful boy and enjoys chasing a rod toy around his pen . He came to the shelter as a stray so unfortunately we don’t have any history on him. He may look big and manly but he is actually a bit softie who just wants to be loved. He would need to live with adults or teenagers only. He does not like other cats or dogs so will need to be the only pet in the home."
