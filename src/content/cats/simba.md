title: "SIMBA"
description: "This delightful boy is called Simba and is about 15 years old. He is a sweet and gentle cat who adores fuss and attention from his human friends. Despite his large size, he can be a little worried initially so will need his new owners to be patient with him while he settles in. Simba is rather overweight so would like to live with someone who has plenty of time to devote to playing with him to help him achieve his summer body! He is still active and enjoys hunting so you may get the occasional ‘gift’ of a mouse from time to time. He may be able to share his home with the odd child but they would need to be of Secondary School age and it would depend on how they get on when they meet at the Shelter. He would prefer to be the only pet in his new home."
