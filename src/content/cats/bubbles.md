title: "BUBBLES"
description: "Beautiful Bubbles has had a bit of a tricky time. Bubbles was very much loved but was living indoors and with young children and also was quite a hormonal and sensitive cat! She was very unhappy and so came in to our care to find a more suitable home.Bubbles was very upset initially and so moved in to our behaviour unit away from other cats and with lots of space to relax, settle and play! It was also clear Bubbles was in season and has since been spayed.2 months later and Bubbles is a different cat! She is so lovely, enjoys fuss, cuddles and loves to play. Hormones are also now a thing of the past! Bubbles may be unsettled again initially in a new home so we hope to find a patient, loving home without pets or children and with a garden she can explore and enjoy.Bubbles really deserves a second chance at a wonderful and happy life."
