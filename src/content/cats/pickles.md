title: "PICKLES"
description: "Please read my profile carefully before applying.Pickles is a young adult female cat who was found straying in poor condition.Since arrival Pickles has been very wary of people. Pickles has spent a few months in a foster home to see if that would help her gain confidence around people in a home environment. Pickles showed little improvement, although she is often heard playing on her own when no one is around! Taking her behaviour traits into account we would like Pickles to go to a rural location with plenty of outdoor space. Potentially to live outside but with the option to venture into the home should she choose to. She would need an annexe, Stable, garage or outdoor building to be settled into first. Over time she may become more relaxed around people and choose the home comforts of the house. She is not a feral cat but she has lacked the socialisation she desperately needed in her earlier years. As she is young and active we feel she will thrive with this type of home. If you meet all of the above rehoming criteria, please complete this Online Application Form. It is really useful if you can please include lots of information on the type of home you can offer."
