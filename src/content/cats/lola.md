title: "LOLA"
description: "Gorgeous Lola is about 13 years old. She is a very friendly and affectionate girl who adores human company and loves to be fussed. She is initially shy in new surroundings so her new owners will need to be patient to allow her to settle in first, once she has she can be quite demanding for attention so would love a new owner who is around for a lot of the time to give her all the love she wants. Lola only has 3 legs but is still an active girl and loves to explore. She may be able to live with children of secondary school age but it would depend on how they all get on when they meet at the Shelter. She would need to be the only pet in the home as does not like other cats or dogs."
