This young gentlemen is Duncan he is 3 years old and looking for some understanding owners. He would like a nice quiet home where there is not too many people going in and out all the time. He is a very nervous boy and will often hiss and run away if he sees you. He is a stray so unfortunately we don't have any history on him. 

We are hoping he will start to feel more comfortable in his new home, as we are not sure what cat he will turn out to be like, if he will start to enjoy fuss in the future or none at all his new owners will need to be happy to keep him regardless of the outcome. He would like to live somewhere that is fairly rural without too many busy roads around. He would need to live with adults only and to be the only pet in the home.
